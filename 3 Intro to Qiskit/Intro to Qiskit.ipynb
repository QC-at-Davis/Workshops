    "\n",
    "A tip that was given in the last workshop was to remember that you can treat each row entry value in a qubit or multi-qubit vector as the chance that you'll get the binary value (minus one) representing the entry's position, starting from zero, upon measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "To clarify, we can look at a two-qubit state vector like so:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\ket{\\text{two-qubit}} = \n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "a_{00} \\\\\n",

    "a_{11} \\\\\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Each entry is a value representing the chance you'll get $\\ket{00}$, $\\ket{01}$. Granted, you need to take the absolute value of that entry and square it but the important thing to note is the positions of the entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first entry encodes the chance of getting $1 - 1 = 0$ or $\\ket{00}$. The second entry encodes the chance of get $2 - 1 = 1$ or $\\ket{01}$. The third entry encodes the chance of getting $3 - 1 = 2$ or $\\ket{10}$, so on and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example is easily extendable to large vectors like the one we made above that represents three qubits in the $\\ket{010}$ configuration:\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "We see that the third entry is $1$ so $3 - 1 = 2$ and $2$ in binary is $010$ so our chances of measuring $\\ket{010}$ is $1$ or 100%.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Partial Measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "With two qubits, the number of ways you can measure the qubits also grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could measure all two qubits simultaneously but you could also measure one qubit first, and then the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "This changes the probability distribution of the entire set of qubits because we've forced one qubit to be in one state so certain configurations are immediately impossible to have.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if I measure my first qubit to be $\\ketzero$, then the remaining probability of the two qubits is spread across $\\ket{00}$ and $\\ket{01}$:\n",
    "\n",
